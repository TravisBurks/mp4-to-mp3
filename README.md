# mp4-to-mp3

*MP4 is one of the most widely used video file formats. You can upload MP4 videos to popular social media sites like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook. Media players like Windows Media Player, VLC, QuickTime, iPhone, iPad and Android are also compatible with MP4 video files*

*MP4s are popular not only for their compatibility with most devices but also for their ability to hold high-resolution videos without taking up much storage space. MP4 stands for MPEG4, and an MP4 file can contain video, audio, images and subtitles*

*An MP3 is a digital audio file thatâ€™s compressed so itâ€™s easy to store and transfer. Itâ€™s a lossy format, meaning it drops some of the audioâ€™s sound when itâ€™s compressed. Most of this dropped sound is inaudible when you play it back, however. MP3 files can be about one-tenth the size of lossless audio files, making them easy to share, store and play back on most devices*
